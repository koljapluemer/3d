# My 3D Prints

My ongoing efforts of learning 3D printing.
Bigger projects are also going to have their own projects, maybe.

## Projects

### 000 Wok Holder

My very first project, trying to attach a wok and its lid on the kitchen wall.

### 001 Finger Rings

Experimenting with ESPs to make a haptic button interface, wearable on a finger.
